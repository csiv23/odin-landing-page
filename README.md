# odin-landing-page
This is my code for the Landing Page project in The Odin Project Foundations course. 

### Project Details
The Odin Project [provided a webpage design](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/odin-project.png) that I needed to clone using HTML and CSS for the desktop. They also [provided a style guide](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/colors_and_stuff.png) for colors and font sizes. The point of this assignment is to create something from scratch and getting various elements in more or less the right position relative to the rest.

### Skills Learned
- Becoming comfortable with the CSS Flexbox model, specifically justify-content and align-item rules
- Recreating a given design using HTML/CSS

### Site Details

This site showcases a brief amount of content about the history of Jazz. It showcases photos and quotes from influential figureheads. Attached below is a screenshot of the site in its entirety.
